üìä Visualizing India's Population Distribution by Age Groups

I recently created a data visualization analyzing India's population distribution across different age groups using Python. Here's what the project demonstrates:

üîç Key Insights:

Breaks down India's massive population into three key demographic segments

Shows both absolute numbers (in millions) and percentage breakdown

Reveals India's demographic dividend with 57% of population in working age (21-64 years)

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation:

python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and filter World Bank data
data = pd.read_csv("population_data.csv", skiprows=4)
india_data = data[data['Country Name'] == 'India']

# Calculate age group populations
age_groups = {
    '0-20 Years': 36.1%, 
    '21-64 Years': 57.0%,
    '65+ Years': 6.9%
}
# Visualization using matplotlib
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
bars = plt.bar(age_groups.keys(), population_values, color=['#4BC0C0','#FF9F40','#66BB6A'])
üìà Why This Matters:

Highlights India's youth demographic advantage

Shows relatively small elderly population (6.9%)

Provides foundation for more detailed demographic analysis

üí° Potential Extensions:

Compare with other countries

Add time-series analysis

Incorporate gender breakdown

The complete code and visualization are available on [https://github.com/ChaithanyaSakamuri/EDA-INDIA-AGE-DISTRIBUTION]. Would love to hear thoughts on other demographic factors worth analyzing!
